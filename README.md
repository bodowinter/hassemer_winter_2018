# Analysis for Hassemer & Winter (2018), "Decoding gestural iconicity"

This is the analysis for Hassemer and Winter (2018). This repository is a rebirth of the following repository, which is kept open for transparency's sake:

https://github.com/bodowinter/new_height_shape

There are three script files, one for each experiment reported:

* E1_production.Rmd
* E2_perspective.Rmd
* E3_selectivity.Rmd

There are five data files:

* E1a.csv - Experiment 1a
* E1b.txt - Experiment 1b
* E2.csv - Perspective experiment
* E3.csv - Raw data of selectivity experiment
* E3_coded.csv - Manually coded text data

The folder "stimuli" contains the stimuli for E2. The stimuli for E3 are a subset of those (described in the paper).
